<p class="Chile1">In this project, we collabed with the Spanish class. For their project they had to give us information on the given country they got. In particular, we got Chile. Our job is to create a website from scrath that acts as a guidetour. We had to plan out the mockups and sitemaps before stepping into the coding. We also incorporated fake advertisements that we designed in graphic design.    
</p>
<p class="Chile2"> 
 In this project, my knowledge on coding gained. Creating the navigation bar was one of the main obstacle for me. Linking it to different pages wasnâ€™t quite easy for me, but now I have further understanding of it. Throughout this project, time management is key as we had deadlines along the way and things must be turned in on time. I have also learned quite a bit of information about our country which is, Chile.

<div class="yya">
<img src="_assets/images/usability.jpg" class="mmo">
</div> 
<p class="mmo1">Every website that is done, usability testing is key. It gives the creator a chance to get feedbacks. This lets them see their flaws within their sites.  </p>
<p class="mmo2">I have learned that construct cticisms from others are important. They can guide us throughout the creation of our websites. They've helped me know what to fix with my flaws. Criticisms will come handy along the way.  </p>
    
    
    
<div class="wwq">
<img src="_assets/images/moodboard.jpg" class="wwqq">
</div> 
<p class="wwqq1">In web design 1, we were given a project that we collaborated with the Spanish class. Before stepping into the code, we were told that moodboard is essential. It creates a set of mood that is important to the audience. In this moodboard, I've implemented neutral colors, so that it is easy to look at. I've also included pictures to really enhance the feel of this moodboard.  </p>
<p class="wwqq2">I have learned that preparation is needed before stepping into coding. You must know the plan before you start or things can become unorganized and messy. This moodboard helped me plan my css, as I knew what colors and theme that I will be going for. </p>
