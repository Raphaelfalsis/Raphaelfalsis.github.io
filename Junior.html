<p class="App1">In class, we were assigned to create an app that would teach young children. My group decided to create a game that will engage them about the environment while having fun. We had enough time to plan out and draw rough sketches. We started by creating cartoon characters and scenes for the game. The software we used are Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. The whole point of this is we want them to be aware of real life issues that concerns recycling, windmill farms, and solar panels. In this generation, children are often distracted from the real world by technology, and by bringing technology to teach children these issues, which will inform them. 
</p>
<p class="App2">Throughout this project, I have showed my designing abilities and some code. This project have helped me grow as a student. My team have helped each other with planning and layouting the steps for this app. As we worked together, I have improved my skills with Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop. As a web designer, those softwares will become handy for me.

    <div class="coo">
<img src="_assets/images/uprise.jpg" class="Company" />
    </div>
<p class="Company1">In this project, our class was divided into groups of 3-4 that represented different design firm companies. My company is named,Uprise. In our groups we created a mission statement that targeted a specific audience, which was teenagers. Our mission statement was, “Rise to creativity”. Before a logo is chosen for the company,  everyone in the group had to create 3 varieties of logo. This was the final logo that was chosen which I’ve made. It represents a paintbrush and an arrow that points towards up, since we are called Uprise. 

</p>
<p class="Company2">Throughout this project, I’ve experienced what it’s like to work in a company. This improved my communication skills as I have learned how to give professional critiques. Teamwork collaboration is an essential, as we collaborated our ideas and went through talks through the process. I was able to give opinions and decided on some designs that helped my fellow teammates .When creating one such, construct critism is key.

      <div class="yoo">
    <img src="_assets/images/award.jpg" class="Congressional" />
    </div>
<p class="Congressional1">As my group have participated in the 2016 Congressional Challenge, we each got awarded. Throughout the project, we were given us a chance to come an app that would help a specific audience. We were challenged with the creation of the app. The coding of the game itself, struggled us, but that’s what made it fun. We created a theme that targeted mainly young children to be aware of the environment. Through the game we made, it features tasks like recyling to inform children, while having fun at the same time. 


</p>
<p class="Congressional2">Throughout this project I have learned time management as deadlines became our obstacle. This proved me that I can mange the responsibility I have for my group. As much as possible, I focused on my part and did what I was suppose to. This app challenge taught me many things, especially the use of MIT App Inventor 2. It’s a software that helped us create the apps we imagined. 

    
    
     <div class="hoo">
    <img src="_assets/images/art.jpg" class="artw" />
    </div>
<p class="artw1">This artwork was one of our main piece in the cover of our "app challenge". I used Adobe Illustrator to create this piece. I used vibrant colors that will sure the chidlren will like. My group's target is to get children to play that will teach them enviromental such. 


</p>
<p class="artw2">I have learned that layering is important. When creating artworks, layering can be easily done. It kept me to work on a particular item that didn't bother other shapes. Colors is an important part of design as it creates different mood.
    
    
    
    
    <div class="kkoo">
    <img src="_assets/images/wireframe.jpg" class="kko" />
    </div>
<p class="kko1">This picture is what a wireframe looks like. It it part of the process when creating a website. It gives the creator an overview of how the site will look and function. In Web design 2, we were thought how to create a wireframe by sketching. 
</p>
<p class="kko2">I have learned that wireframe is important. It sets a general overview of what the website will look like. It also helped me along the way in my coding. Without wireframe, things will become unorganized and messy.
