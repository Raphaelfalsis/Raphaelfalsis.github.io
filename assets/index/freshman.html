<p class="Carepackage1">In freshman studies, We were able to given a chance to create care packages for the homeless. Our task was to create a box with theme that will suit the appropriate age we decided to give it to. For my group, we chose ages 15 and below. Since we’ve targeted young children, we chose “Crayola” as our theme for the box we’ve created. Shoe box is what we used to hold school materials. We’ve also included a handmade coloring book for the children.</p>
<p class="Carepackage2">In the project, I was able to give to the needy. My group and I have brought school items that would help our main target audience which are young children. It felt good to hand out help to those in need. Even little things to us can mean a lot to them. We knew that this care package would be valuable to the child that’s going to receive it.</p>

<p class="Midnight1"> In graphic design 1, we were given a task to create a poster that relates to our theme. Specifically, I chose retro art. We were given enough time to create multiple posters, but I chose this as my final. In this illustration I’ve implented bright and neon colors that made this poster pop. This assignment was our task to explain the process that lead to the final result. 
</p>
<p class="Midnight2"> In this assignment I did, I used Adobe Illustrator. This leveled up my experience with the software and made me even better. As I created this illustration I have found solutions to my own problems as I worked throughout it. Using gradient, transparency, layering, and shading was what I learned in this lesson. My skill with this software improved. </p>


<div class="waa"> 
<img src="_assets/images/photoshop.jpg" class="Photoshop" />
</div>
<p class="Photoshop1"> Throughout graphic design 1, we were introduced to Adobe Photoshop. This software is an image editing tool. This helped me learn how to edit pictures by using different tools such as hue/saturation, magic wand tool, and more. During that year we were tested with our skills with Adobe Photoshop.  
</p>
<p class="Photoshop2"> Receiving the certificate showed me that I have learned the main components of photoshop.  </p>
    
<div class="raa">
<img src="_assets/images/Illustrator.jpg" class="Illustrator" />
</div>
<p class="Illustrator1"> Throughout graphic design 1, we were introduced to Adobe Illustrator. We were thought with the basics and tricks of this software. It helped me create illustrations with the use of pen tool in the software. During that year we were tested with our skills with Adobe Illustrator. Some questions varied from multiple choice to drag and drop. For those that haven’t passed on the first try, we were able to retake it again till we passed. 

</p>
<p class="Illustrator2"> Before I received this certificate, I’ve learned quite the skills in Adobe Illustrator. It taught me the basic skills that I will soon get better at. Every year I just get better with the software as I learn different tools to create one such.

    <img src="_assets/images/me.jpg" class="myself" />
    </div>
<p class="myself1">   In graphic design 1, we were given a task to create an illustration. First, I took a picture of myself and exported it to illustrator. Next, I have the freedom to mess around with the software that will result as a cartoon. The only thing we can use are colors and shapes by using the pen tool. This asignment was quite challenging as a tried to make my portrait as realistic as possible. 
</p>
<p class="myself2"> 
In freshman year, it was the beginning for us to get hands on with Adobe Illustrator. At first, I wasn't so good at it, but as I progress, I even got comfortable with the software. This taught me the basics of it. From using tools to shortcut commands, Adobe Illustrator became my favorite software. With this project I got to know how to balance colors and use appropriate shapes in specific areas to create an illustrated portrait of me.

    </div>
<p class="excel1">  In Business Software Apps. we are thought different softwares such as Microsoft Excel. In this assignment we are particularly thought how to create graphs. I chose pie graph. Coding formulas in excel was our lesson.
</p>
<p class="excel2"> 
This thought me how to use Microsoft Excel in a different way. I never knew codig was such a thing on this software. This software have different ways to be used. Mainly it is excellent in creating different types of charts and graphs. This is something that I could use in the future.
